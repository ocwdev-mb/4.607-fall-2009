This section contains instructions for two short papers and the in-class debates.

Paper 1
-------

Produce a short paper (1 to 1.5 pages maximum) on the topic "The difference between art and architecture." Use whatever material you want.

Paper 2
-------

On each of your papers there will be one, maybe two, suggestions about Paper 2. The suggestions are based on something in your paper that needs further development or explanation. Please write a 1-2 page (260-400 words) paper on this topic.

Unlike Paper 1, this paper will be considered a research paper. We will expect footnotes to books and articles. Please use proper citation methods. We are not looking for opinion, but critical erudition.

Each paper must have at least one footnote starting with "For further reading, see…"

Each paper must have a footnote starting with "During the research for this paper, I was struck by…" (or something to that effect).

There will be a certain amount of secondary material that you can use. While you will want to package this in your paper, we are interested in knowing what primary material you used as well, whether a text or an object.

### Tips for Paper 2

Whereas in the first paper you probably thought of the text as a type of monologue, in this paper you should see yourself as an educator. For example, if you are working on Richard Serra, either give some biography or lead the reader to a relevant source. Is there a significant book that covers the issue that you are working on? Then that has to be mentioned.

The first time you mention a name, use the full name. Do not say 'Peter,' for Peter Eisenman. Do not say 'Eisenman.' Say, Peter Eisenman. Then you can use 'Eisenman.'

Remember to cite all web sources, including Wikipedia.

Though we are looking for density of information and erudition, this is still a paper where we are looking for an underlying argument or position. You can agree with someone, disagree with someone, or even be neutral in the face of a debate.

Debate Instructions

### Debate Format

5-minute opening \[Team A\]

5-minute rebuttal \[Team B\]

5-minute opening \[Team B\]

5-minute rebuttal \[Team A\]

Open discussion

5-minute closing \[Team B\]

5-minute closing \[Team A\]

### Requirements

The opening and closing statements should be printed out and handed in at the beginning of class.

Each team should select a reading for the rest of the class. This reading is a resource you have to bring classmates over to your side — take advantage of it.

Each team should try to take advantage of its members' strengths — some people might do research, some people might be better for opening with a planned, read statement, and others might be better for the rebuttal, which requires you to react to your opponent' statement. All should participate in the open discussion.

Each team should meet separately to plan and practice opening and closing arguments, deliberate on strategy, etc. Once the team has met, they get one 1-hour meeting with the TA to practice their arguments.

Theatrical mischief is encouraged, but should be grounded with intellectual rigor.
